# Budget-Manager
# This GUI program has two frames in the main window. The user uses
# the first frame to input budgets, which are recorded in a file as
# categories with corresponding dollar amounts. The second fram is
# used to input categorized transactions. There is an analyze button
# that launches a window that displays a table with the category spend
# totals and the variance of these totals from the budgeted amounts.
